> A modern, full-featured client & task management dashboard — built to showcase professional-grade **React/Next.js UI development**.

DashPro is a polished client-management dashboard built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It focuses on real-world UI/UX: searchable/sortable client tables, progress tracking, CSV export, and smooth modals — aimed to look great in a hiring manager’s browser and feel snappy for day-to-day use.
